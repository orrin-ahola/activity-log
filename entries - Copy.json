Also when editing, it puts the data into the new entry section which is quirky, but overall not bad.  Also when you add an entry, it displays at the bottom until you refresh the page. \n I would eventually like to fix these issues.  Also I would like to make it web based so I can access this from any computer and my phone.  Log in authentication etc."
